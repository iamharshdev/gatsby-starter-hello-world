Best fonts for your terminal.

As developers, we stare at code all day. Making sure that code is
presented in a legible and clear format is table stakes for productive
coding. What are some great monospaced fonts aimed at displaying code?

-   **[Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/)**

    This font comes with font ligatures as well as “semi-connected
    cursive italics”. Some developers prefer to customize their IDE’s to
    display comments in this cursive style as a way of differentiating
    the text from code.

-   **[Ubuntu
    Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono?preview.text_type=custom)**

    Ubuntu Mono is a monospaced typeface commissioned by Canonical
    (creators of Ubuntu Linux) to complement the look and feel of their
    Linux distribution.

-   **[Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles)**

    Another free font with font ligatures designed for a great coding
    experience.

-   **[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)**

    It’s incredibly easy to get started with and incorporate with VS
    Code, and includes some pretty sweet font ligatures!

-   **[Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)**

    This one is built by Source Foundry and the demo page does a
    wonderful job explaining its benefits.

-   **[Input](https://input.djr.com/)**

    Input is only free for private use so you won’t be able to use it to
    style code blocks on your website, but it looks pretty great in your
    IDE.

-   **[Source Code
    Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro)**

    Source Code Pro was designed “to work well in user interface (UI)
    environments”, and the designer also created a sans-serif companion
    font “Source Sans.”

-   **[Anonymous
    Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anonymous+Pro?preview.text_type=custom)**

    Anonymous Pro is designed as a coding font with a few specific
    improvements over others in mind: Characters that could be mistaken
    for each other like 0 (zero) vs O (capital O) are intentionally
    differentiated, and the font is built to work well down to very
    small sizes.

All fonts were choosen only if they were Monospaced and also were free
to use on all types of systems.
